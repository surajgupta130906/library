# Library Book Management System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a simple **Library Book Management System** developed as part of a
Software Engineering assignment. The main objective is to demonstrate the use of
**Agile sprint-based development**, **Git version control**, and **traceability** while
building a small but functional software system.

The system manages books using **in-memory data structures only** (no database).
